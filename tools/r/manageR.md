## Managing data

* seq(pi,9) : sequence of numbers
* seq_along(xx), seq(alongwith=xx) : sequence mimics
  * rep(0, times = xx) : repeats a number
  * rep(c(0,1,2), times = 10)
  * rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)
* paste(my_char, collapse = " ") : concatenates strings
  * paste(1:3,c("X","Y","Z"),sep="")
* sample(t,100,repalace=TRUE) : takes a sample with or without replacement
* identical(vect, vect2) : Checns if two objects are equal
* cbind(x,y) : Concatenate by columns
* rbint(x,y) : Concatenate by rows
* rank(y) - Returns the sample ranks of the values in a vector
  * rank(sort(x))
* reorder(x, y) : By default treats its first argument as a categorical variable, and reorders its levels based on the values of a second variable
* which(x>0) : Give the ‘TRUE’ indices of a logical object, allowing for array indices.

## Inspecting variables
* attributes(x) : Shows object's attributes
* names(x) : Shows object's names
* class(x) : Shows object's class
* str(x) : Shows internal structure of the object


## Working with NA

* mice::md.pattern(x)        - Display missing-data patterns
* mice::mice(x, method='rf') - Generates Multivariate Imputations by Chained Equations (MICE).
* mice::complete(mice_out)   - Fills NA with the model generated by mice
